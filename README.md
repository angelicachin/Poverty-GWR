# Poverty-GWR

Poverty is still an important issue in Indonesia, so a comprehensive analysis is needed to identify influencing factors and improve prediction models. This study uses Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to assess poverty rates in 34 provinces in Indonesia, considering indicators such as education completion rate, sanitation, drinking water, health facilities, home ownership, and electricity supply with Ordinary Least 
Square (OLS) as the reference. This study aims to overcome the spatial variation problem of the OLS method by using GWR, which goes beyond the limitations of OLS and Weighted Least Square (WLS) regression models. Early findings show that education completion rate, adequate sanitation, and drinking water significantly affect the poverty rate. Comparison with Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Weighted Least Square (WLS), shows the superiority of GWR in terms of explanatory power (R-squared), at 0.8195 and model fit (AIC), at 530.1814. The GWR model, using a fixed Gaussian Kernel Function Bandwidth, outperformed the other models, providing valuable insights for policy makers to formulate targeted strategies in poverty reduction efforts in Indonesia.
